          <p>When we sit to meditate, we are looking after ourselves in ways that might not at first
           seem obvious. The benefits of meditation are numerous and varied, and supported by science.
            Many people start meditating to manage stress, reduce anxiety, and to cultivate peace of mind.
             But there are thousands of studies documenting other less-known mindfulness meditation benefits,
              which can have a positive impact on mental, physical, and emotional health. Read on to find out
            more about the many health benefits of meditation you may experience when you establish a practice
             and repeat it consistently.</p>

          <h2>Mental health benefits of meditation</h2>
          <p>Most people are likely familiar with the positive side effects of meditation
           associated with mental health: increased awareness, clarity, compassion,
           and a sense of calm. Improved focus is another benefit commonly associated with meditation.</p>
          <p>
          There are even more ways meditation can benefit the mind.
           In a study , researchers from John Hopkins University found general meditation programs helped ease psychological
           symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain related to stress.

          <h2>Physical benefits of meditation</h2>
          <p>
          To appreciate the profound physical benefits of meditation, 
          it’s important to understand how chronic stress can wreak havoc on the body.
          </p>
        <p>Stress stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, causing a surge of natural
         stress hormones (think: epinephrine and cortisol) in the bloodstream, which can
          negatively affect the body. For example, too much epinephrine (a.k.a. adrenaline)
           can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes; too much cortisol can increase
            blood sugar levels, suppress the immune system, and constrict blood vessels. Eventually,
             chronic spikes in stress hormones can lead to an increase in blood pressure,
         heart rate, and cholesterol levels, disrupting immunity, energy levels, and sleep.</p>

         <p>When the body and mind are relaxed, however — whether through meditation practice
          or other techniques — the parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated,
           causing the body to stop releasing stress hormones. Many people who meditate 
           regularly have learned to condition their body to relax on demand, and, according to
            research, can more effectively manage stress. According to research from the University
             of California, Davis, people who used generalized meditations programs
            have lower levels of cortisol.</p>

            <p>Why is stress reduction so important? It lowers blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption,
             which results in higher energy levels and better immunity and sleep. Plus, 
        stress reduction is key for diminishing the physical symptoms of many health conditions.
Take inflammation, for example, which is linked to stroke, heart disease,
 cancer, diabetes, and other serious diseases. According to a Harvard study, meditation not only can dampen the genes involved in the inflammatory response,
 but also promotes the genes associated with DNA stability.</p>

          <h2>Emotional benefits of meditation</h2>
          <p>
          The brain is the part of the body where meditation can really work its magic.
           It’s certainly true that we become more capable of coping with negative emotions
            when we meditate and practice viewing heightened emotions as passing states.
             But one of the most profound advantages of meditation is that it can not only
              change our mindset and perspective, it can also physically alter our brains,
           rewiring them toward more positive thoughts and emotions. Here’s how it works.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Meditation can decrease negative neurological connections to the medial prefrontal cortex
           — or the “me center” of the brain — dampening traits such as fear, stress, and anxiety.
            Alternatively, it also builds new positive neurological connections
           to the parts of the brain responsible for promoting traits like focus and decision-making.
          </p>
        
          <p>
          Moreover, research shows that gray matter — the area of the brain responsible for emotional
           regulation, planning, and problem-solving — as well as the cortical thickness, responsible
            for learning and memory, both increase with regular meditation practice. Alternatively,
             the amygdala,
           which regulates how we feel stress, fear, and anxiety, responds to meditation by shrinking.
