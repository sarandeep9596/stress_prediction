          <p>“Take a deep breath” might be some of the best advice around.
           It’s one of the easiest and most effective ways to relieve stress,
            and has been for thousands of years. When we take a slow inhale through the nose and a big,
             long exhale through the mouth, we’re signaling to the brain and body that we’re safe,
              that it’s okay to calm down.
           Within a matter of seconds, we start to feel more relaxed.</p>
           <p>Most of us rarely need to think about breathing. But learning to pay attention to
            our breath can improve how we feel and how we behave. Often, taking a moment before
             we react to stressful situations can make all the difference. With practice, we can
              purposefully slow
            down our breath anytime and anywhere until we feel less frazzled and more confident.</p>

          <h2>What exactly are breathing exercises?</h2>
          <p>Breathing exercises, or breathwork, is when we intentionally control how to breathe
           to experience a sense of relaxation and calm in the mind and body. Anyone who’s taken
            a yoga class has done breathwork, inhaling and exhaling steadily with each new pose.
             Or, we may have been prompted to take a few deep breaths during a guided meditation
              or a Headspace sleepcast. Since breathing techniques aren’t only useful during wellness
               activities, we can practice
           them whenever we need them so that we can respond to stress in a more skillful way.</p>
          <p>
          When we get anxious, we likely notice that our breath is shallow and short. We might be
           breathing through the mouth and only breathing into the top areas of the lungs. That
            restricts airflow in the body and can cause tense or uncomfortable sensations.
             Maybe our heart feels like it’s racing, we get sweaty, or we feel tightness in 
             certain areas. So, if we accidentally spill coffee on our shirt during an important
              work meeting, our rapid breath — a natural response to stress — might actually be making
           it more difficult for us to clean up, compose ourselves, and settle back into the agenda.
          </p>
          <p>But research shows that deep breathing and other breathwork techniques help us calm
           down during moments of stress. When we intentionally breath deeper and through the nose,
            we might notice our breath is pushing out our stomach. This is a sign that our lungs are
             fully expanding and increasing airflow in the body — that’s just what we want. We’re also
              activating our “rest and digest” system, which tells the body to relax. Another study shows
               that deep-breathing exercises may help us improve our focus so that we can pay attention
                to our reactions and be more present
           (not caught up in our embarrassment or annoyance about that spilled drink).</p>

          <h2>Learn more about mindfulness</h2>
          <p>
          You may have heard that mindfulness — the ability to be fully present in the moment
           — can have numerous benefits, everything from decreased stress and sadness to
            increased levels focus and happiness, according to general mindfulness research.
             But what exactly is mindfulness? And, how can you recognize it and reap its many benefits?
              Mindfulness meditation practice is one way to truly experience the current moment and 
              integrate that awareness into your everyday life. 
          Here’s everything you need to know to get started.
          </p>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation doesn’t only change our mindset and perspective,
         it actually can change the shape of our brains. Generalized neuroimaging meditation
          studies found that 8 weeks of mindfulness meditation also changes our brains,
         rewiring them towards more positive thoughts and emotions.</p>

         <p>For starters, meditation allows us to move from high-frequency brain waves to a lower
          frequency, which activates (and, potentially even more importantly, deactivates) certain 
          areas of the brain. For example, it can decrease neurological connections to the medial 
          prefrontal cortex, or the “me center,” diminishing traits such as fear, stress, and anxiety.
           In turn, meditation can also build new pathways to the parts
          of the brain responsible for traits like focus and decision-making.</p>

            <p>And that’s not all: mindfulness meditation can actually change the shape of the brain as well,
             a process known as neuroplasticity. Research shows that gray matter — the area of the brain
              responsible for emotional regulation, planning, and problem-solving — as well as the cortical
               thickness — responsible for learning and memory — both increase with regular meditation practice.
                Alternatively,
             the amygdala, which regulates how we feel stress, fear, and anxiety, decreases in size.</p>

          <h2>increased focus</h2>
          <p>
          you may have experienced a flow state at some point — that sense of fluidity between your body
           and mind, where you are totally absorbed by and deeply focused on something, beyond the point
            of distraction. Time feels like it has slowed down. Your senses are heightened. You are at
             one with the task at hand, as action and awareness sync to create an effortless momentum.
              Some people describe this feeling as being “in the zone.” This is the flow state and it’s
               accessible to everyone, whether
           you’re engaged in a physical activity, a creative pursuit, or even a simple day-to-day task.
          </p>
          <h3>What it means to be in a flow state</h3>
          <p>
          Popularized by positive psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura, flow state describes a feeling where,
           under the right conditions, you become fully immersed in whatever you are doing.
          </p>
        
          <p>
          “There’s this focus that, once it becomes intense, leads to a sense of ecstasy,
           a sense of clarity: you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;
            you get immediate feedback,” Csikszentmihalyi said in a 2004 TED Talk. Csikszentmihalyi
             and Nakamura reached this conclusion by interviewing a variety of self-actualized,
              high-performing people:
           including mountain climbers, chess players, surgeons, and ballet dancers.</p>
           <p>When you’re giving your fullest attention to an activity or task that you are incredibly passionate about, singularly focused on, and totally immersed in, you may find yourself creating the conditions necessary to experience a flow state of mind. The mind’s usual chatter begins to fade away, placing us in a non-distracted zone. The feelings that would consume you under normal circumstances (inhibition, hunger, fatigue, or aches and pains) melt away, and all that matters is your dedication to your craft.</p>
        <p>The flow mental state is generally less common during periods of relaxation and makes itself present during challenging and engaging activities. According to Csikszentmihalyi, “The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times… the best moments usually occur if a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” To that end, engagement and concentration are key in achieving flow state.</p>
        <p>According to Csikszentmihalyi, the human mind can process up to 120 bits of information per second. When we’re challenging ourselves with a task, our mind reaches full capacity. If the activity at hand happens to be something we enjoy and we’re good at, we achieve a flow mental state — and it can leave us feeling ecstatic, motivated and fulfilled.</p>

          <h2>Five mindful minutes</h2>
          <p>
          Five minutes of mindfulness can be a great way to set the tone for your day.
           Here are some tips for practicing mindfulness for five minutes: </p>
           <p>
           <li>Relax your body: Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.</li>
           <li>Focus on your breath: Inhale slowly from your belly, then into your ribs, chest, and crown of your head. Hold your breath for a count of five. 
           Set an intention: Set a positive intention for yourself. </li>
           <li>Don't worry: It's okay to just sit there and don't worry about looking silly.</li>
           </p>
           <p>Research suggests that short periods of mindfulness can be just as beneficial as
            longer periods. In fact, one study found that four 5-minute mindfulness practices were
             just as effective
            as four 20-minute practices for improving anxiety, depression, and stress. </p>
            <p>Mindfulness can have a positive impact on your health and well-being. It can help reduce anxiety and depression,
             lower blood pressure, improve sleep, and help people cope with pain. </p>
